How to create a stamp card
{% endembed %}

### How stamp card works:

A stamp card is a loyalty card that rewards customers for purchases or visits. Customers earn stamps for qualifying actions and can redeem a reward after collecting a set number. For example, after collecting 10 stamps, they receive a free coffee. The client can see on the card how many stamps they've collected, how many more are needed for a reward, and when a reward has been earned. Once the reward is redeemed, you, as the business owner, deduct the reward from the client's card, and the client starts collecting stamps again.



1. Upon successful login, navigate to the left-hand menu.
2. From the list of modules, click the <img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2Fdwvv3o54gpuhAez3wybk%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3fa79e9b-6537-4341-81d8-5652bfed4989" alt="" data-size="line">icon. Doing so opens the Cards module.

3. Here, you can either create a card using a template from a list of a wide range of pre-loaded templates or create one from scratch. To develop a better understanding, we will take a look at card creation from scratch.\

4. To do so, click the <img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FPz6xkMxEzisvhd93RHup%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d2379df0-6356-45e8-8028-d5f2d8ddb256" alt="" data-size="line">button.

5. This initiates the stamp card creation workflow. A card is created by filling in the details in 5 sections that include Card Type, Settings, Design, Information, and Save and preview. Let us take a look at how each section works.

### **Card Type**

1. This is the first section. Here, you make a selection regarding the type of card you want to create.\

2. From the available card types, click **Stamp**.\

3. Once selected, click the **Continue** button. As a result, you land on the **Settings** section.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FxSHZ9CRZLGKHr66T6I42%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=11aaaf08-32fe-426f-b3ad-f02f079983df" alt=""><figcaption><p>Select Card Type &#x26; Continue</p></figcaption></figure>

### **Settings**

1. Here, choose: the Barcode Type (1), Reward Program (2) and Card expiration date (3)&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FO7rczCMNtERUr0LT3Okh%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5925fba3-5898-45c5-ac89-618b3e4ed587" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**The type of barcode** determines how the card can be scanned and recognized by the system.You can choose the appearance you like.

In the **Rewards Program** section, select how customers will earn stamps to earn stamps.

**Spend** – Customers earn stamps based on the amount they spend. For example, if you set it to give 1 stamp per $10 spent, a customer spending $30 would receive 3 stamps.

**Visit** – Customers earn a stamp each time they visit, regardless of how much they spend. For example, if you set it to 1 stamp per visit, every time they check in at your business, they get a stamp.

**Stamps** – This allows for custom rules where stamps can be given based on specific conditions you set (e.g., certain products purchased, actions completed, or special promotions).

**Products** (Give stamps based on the goods in the receipt) - This rule for stamp accrual applies only when integrated with Toast

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FoQZ39Pqom2JNfY6sLaQB%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f86f63bf-598d-4cda-962a-cd92a00d9e2d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you enable "Restrict to 1 check-in per customer per day," customers will receive rewards only once per day, regardless of multiple check-ins.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FTFBuWqWD21KUIoAMJ02l%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9bb49c14-a70f-49f3-8ab4-f32b5ef30ab7" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Card expiration date unlimited -** the card has no expiration date. The client can use it as much as he/she wants.

**Card expiration date Fixed term -** The customer will not be able to use the card when this date occurs. The card will not be deleted from the client's phone.

**Card expiration date Fixed term after card issuing -** As this option is selected, the Term dropdowns are displayed. Here, you can select the number of days upon card activation after which it expires.

**How do you want to reward your customers? -** Mandatory field, specify the name of the reward, for example - free coffee. This is the gift that the customer receives. Reward cost - business costs of a loyalty program.

❗️ Mandatory when integrating with Toast.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2Fm92716eT3VOpwpQ8EMEC%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=60663149-fdae-4177-892c-3973bc7256b4" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Happy hours -** A setting that allows you to select the time period during which an increased number of stamps will be credited to the card when a customer visits (in accordance with the specified parameters).\
❗️ **Please note** that this option only works when the stamp is awarded for visas and for the amount spent, i.e. the **spend** mode and **visits**. This stamp does not have a specific validity period.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FatZtWOdzJKgkQmvlWtrI%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=017b8ea4-942e-4551-8e9f-51ab6d30e18d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FaHxZIzVY1vuEedQrsyyc%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a37190d0-9093-4623-83d3-dc4455aa1447" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Happy hours</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

In this way, it is possible to accrue an increased number of stamps.



2. Next, you can set the stamp life (4), the locations (5) and the card language (6)

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FbI2hYjgzKruI0tjBtJGN%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=12bff91d-b4a9-4686-88f2-86dd797b9965" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Stamp life -** here, you can define the number of days a stamp remains valid after it is earned.

If the stamps have already reached the award level, they will not expire. Awards do not have an expiration date.

Each stamp has its own expiration countdown, starting from the date it was earned. It doesn't matter whether the customer earns more stamps or not — each stamp will be removed individually once its validity period ends.

**Example**:\
If you set the validity to 1 month and a customer earns a stamp on April 5, that specific stamp will expire and be removed from the card on May 5.

**In the Locations** field, enter the location(s) of your business to send the push message. This push will be received by the customer who has a card installed in Apple Wallet. The customer will receive this push when they are within range (100 meters).  You can add multiple locations, it can be any address, not necessarily a business address. [Learn more about how to set up (change) geolocation push](../geolocations).

**The language** in which you want to create the stamp card using the dropdown.



3. Next, you can configure the **Date Format (7)**, **Thousands Separator** **Decimal Separator (8)**, and **Purchase Amount When Charging (9)**.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2F1IDl9XYBbNNwukPQf27g%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=60bd9158-a647-4456-be27-ae072874fc4a" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Date Format  -** determines how the date is displayed on the card. If the card does not have an expiration date, this setting is irrelevant.

**Thousands Separator** **Decimal Separator -**  for the card stamp, this setting is irrelevant. Since this type of card has no points. But for other card types, this setting defines how the point balance will be displayed on the customer's card installed on their phone.

The "**Purchase amount when charging**" setting if turned on requires the purchase amount to be entered whenever a transaction is processed. The entered purchase amount will be counted in the ROI statistics, in the revenue figure. \
✅Applies only to transactions made via the scanner. If this setting is disabled, the purchase amount is optional when using the scanner.\


4. Next, you can configure the **card issuance form (10)** and **UTM tags (11)**.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FHCBot6ZfS4OFiQoF1G74%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=8c468d1d-898a-456f-97ec-7dc1ec5c5699" alt=""><figcaption><p>Field Type and UTM tags</p></figcaption></figure>

**The** **Card Issuing Form** - here, you can define the fields you want to include on the stamp card. \
You can delete any fields using the shopping cart icon. A phone number or email is required.\
This is the form that the customer fills out when the card is installed.

In case you want to make a field mandatory, enable the **"Required" toggle**.\
This means the customer won’t be able to install the card without filling in this field.\
\
**The "Unique" toggle** means that this field must contain unique values — typically used for phone numbers.\
We do **not** recommend making other fields unique. For example, if you mark the "Name" field as unique, it would mean that another customer with the same name wouldn't be able to install the card.

You can add fields, you can rename the name of the fields. If you want to create a new field, click the **Add field** button. This adds a new field from where you can select the field type and enter the name of the field for it to be added on the card.

**UTM** - here, you can create a channel link for the analytics to be tracked of the traffic generated by that channel. For instance, if you add Facebook in this field, Boomerangme will generate a URL automatically associated to a UTM tag.

You can create as many links as you want with a UTM tag. This way you can understand which loyalty card distribution channel works best.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FX2oqXAgrvuhnKWZCYphy%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1c434e3d-d306-4e26-ba7a-5e70bd2fcd25" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You see a unique link with a UTM tag and a QR code with the same UTM tag. Later you will be able to see in the statistics how many clients have installed the card by this tag.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FzXuxfGdgCWmRUfOOcxbS%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=cbb1906f-e9fe-4987-a174-0c3a59f13d66" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5. Next, you can configure the **Phone mask (12)**, **Privacy policy (13), Google Wallet Installation button (14) and PWA Installation button (15)**.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FwjMFL6Xu2yenHKaYcoO0%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4df5c18a-0797-4c57-b5dc-be073ec67db6" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The **Phone Mask (12) -** from the drop-down list you can select which country prefix will be specified by default in the card issuance form. If the client has a phone of another country, it is not a problem, the client will be able to choose another country.

**Privacy policy (13) -** consent is displayed on the card's release form. The customer must accept the condition before installing the card. This text can be supplemented if necessary. In case you want to include the privacy policy on the card, enable the toggle button next to the Privacy Policy heading. Moreover, you can also edit the privacy policy using the field below the heading.

**Google Wallet Installation button (14) -** if enabled, allows the Google Wallet button to be displayed in the card installation form thereby allowing customers to add their digital loyalty card to Google Wallet for easy access. Useful for Android users.

**PWA Installation button (15) -** if turned on, enables the PWA (Progressive Web App) button on the card install form. It behaves like a native mobile app but doesn’t require installation from an app store. Customers can install the loyalty card as a web app on their devices.



6. Next, you can configure the **Limit the number of cards issued (16), Limit the number of stamp accruals per day (17) and Number of stamps when issuing a card (18)**

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2F94ue1nq8CoIqgUS7g2gO%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9a6fd6a0-455d-43cc-bd23-f0b75f1f84b5" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Limit the number of cards issued (16) -** controls how many cards can be distributed (0 means unlimited). For example, if this promotion is for a specific number of customers (cardholders).

**Limit the number of stamp accruals per day (17) -** controls how many stamps a customer can earn in a day.

**Number of stamps when issuing a card (18) -** sets the starting number of stamps a customer gets upon receiving the card (default is 0). Welcome Stamps.

**Number of birthday stamps -** On the customer's birthday, the specified number of additional stamps will be credited to their card. The customer will receive a push notification informing them that their stamp balance has increased. This stamp has no specific expiration date.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2F5c0ecrNecpXf3vdDVcFw%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b32494d6-cfed-4318-9015-a412a835d190" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Number of birthday stamps</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

7\. If you want to include a customized script for analytics, you can include this script in the **Analytics** field.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FCbdFlJh9hbZeH9jKrtA1%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b7870868-27a1-46fa-8fb6-ad1399d71e98" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the required fields are filled, click the **Continue** button. This takes you to the **Design** section.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FGnRijjU4ck8EAVv73wE4%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9c657281-d9f3-4d47-b44e-d8c14b7ba417" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### **Design**

This section lets you configure the design of the stamp card.\


1. Starting off, choose the number of stamps at which the reward can be redeemed from the **Stamp Count** heading.  This setting cannot be changed after the card has been activated. You cannot change the position of stamps (i.e. you cannot make the stamps in one row, etc.). The position of stamps is strictly defined and depends on the number of stamps.

<figure><img src="https://121681468-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FBfW4nnOu4AysbkbyxNug%2Fuploads%2FXfVk3qgDOrcI4CdbIYLY%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f2addf23-c0d3-4b2a-8088-b86b1126b963" alt=""><figcaption><p>Stamp Coun</p></figcaption></figure>
